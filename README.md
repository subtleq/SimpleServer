SimpleServers
===

With modern concern regarding privacy at an all time high, this project aims to help demystify how the internet works.  To that end, several generic servers will be developed in very simple forms.  Note that these will largely be considered unuseable for any real work due to the numerous safeguards that would have to be implemented to prevent known attacks.

The types of servers that are being considered for development are as follows

-

Simple Web Server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server)
a simple web server used to present a web site.

Simple Mail Server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_server)
a simple mail server used to serve email.

Simple File Server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server)
a simple file server to allow remote access of files.

Simple Proxy Server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server)
a simple proxy server to allow tunneling.

Simple Name Server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server)
a simple name server to handle DNS lookup requests.

Additionally, several utility classes will be developed, including a logging interface and a socket wrapper.
