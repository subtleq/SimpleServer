SimpleServer
============

The purpose of this project is to create a series of internet enabled servers for learning and use.  Primarily, this is a place for me to try to learn just what the servers we use everyday actually do.  Also, because this is mostly about me learning, these will be developed to be as platform independent as possible.

To this end, the following servers will be implemented eventually:

Simple Web Server
a simple web server used to serve a blog I will write.

Simple Mail Server
a simple mail server used to serve email to/from the blog above.

Simple File Server
a simple file server (which protocol?) to serve me files across multiple systems.


To facilitate the internet connections, a Simple Socket Library will be created for use.
