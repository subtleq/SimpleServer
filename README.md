SimpleServer
============

The purpose of this project is to create a series of internet enabled servers for learning and use.  Primarily, this is a place for me to try to learn just what the servers we use everyday actually do.

To this end, the following servers will be implemented eventually:

Simple Web Server
a simple web server used to serve a blog I will write.

Simple Mail Server
a simple mail server used to serve email to/from the blog above.

Simple File Server
a simple file server (which protocol?) to serve me files across multiple systems.
